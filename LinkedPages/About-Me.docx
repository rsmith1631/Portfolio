My journey to becoming a software engineer begin long before I knew. I’m always looking for an opportunity to do some creative or advancing my
 skills in the unknown. With that attitude, I started my own business through Shopify. I learned how my own sites whenever I needed to. I seen a 
 great opportunity to start a productive business and reaching numerous amounts of people, promoting my business online. I was a builder, but 
 never knew anything about html and css. I was curious about it knowing that the sites that I build was created using these languages. Eventually,
  things didn’t work out with my businesses…  and I seen an opportunity to purse another love of mine joining the travel industry.

After a few years of working in the travel industry, I begin to think I wasn’t working a job that I love, but a job that I like. It’s always been
 a good job, but I wanted to see if there was something different for me. I thought about coding, and knew a little about it but not much. I would 
 hear about from time to time. I thought I’d look into. After looking around, I came across FreeCodeCamp and seen that I can start learning for 
 free. I wasn’t serious about, I thought I try it. It wouldn’t hurt right?! While learning how to code using the language I was always curious 
 about, I was learning something that I enjoyed doing. Learning html and css was great. I was creating projects with the language I wanted to know 
 more about. I wanted to learn more about coding, but I didn’t know where to start, how to go about it. 

I begin looking into coding Boot Camps and came across TrueCoders. This was an opportunity to receive guidance in the languages I should learn, 
the path I should go down… and so on and so forth. After different projects, new connections and guidance by the staff I been ready to pursue my 
career in software engineering. I’ve enjoyed my journey; I look forward to joining a team that shares the excitement that I have for this industry.
 My goal is to create some creative apps and continue to learn more. It’s been great so far and I can see myself in a prominent position being 
 productive for a long time.
